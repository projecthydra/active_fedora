      # Allows for a relationship to be treated like any other attribute of a model class. You define
      # relationships in your model class using this method.  You then have access to several
      # helper methods to list, append, and remove objects from the list of relationships. 
      # ====Examples to define two relationships 
      #  class AudioRecord < ActiveFedora::Base
      #
      #   has_relationship "oral_history", :has_part, :inbound=>true, :type=>OralHistory
      #   # returns all similar audio
      #   has_relationship "similar_audio", :has_part, :type=>AudioRecord
      #   #returns only similar audio with format wav
      #   has_relationship "similar_audio_wav", :has_part, :solr_fq=>"format_t:wav"
      #
      # The first two parameters are required:
      #   name: relationship name
      #   predicate: predicate for the relationship
      #   opts:
      #     possible parameters  
      #       :inbound => if true loads an external relationship via Solr (defaults to false)
      #       :type => The type of model to use when instantiated an object from the pid in this relationship (defaults to ActiveFedora::Base)
      #       :solr_fq => Define a solr query here if you want to filter out some objects in your relationship (must be a properly formatted solr query)
      #
      # If inbound is true it expects the relationship to be defined by another object's RELS-EXT
      # and to load that relationship from Solr.  Otherwise, if inbound is true the relationship is stored in
      # this object's RELS-EXT datastream
      #
      # Word of caution - The same predicate may not be used twice for two inbound or two outbound relationships.  However, it may be used twice if one is inbound
      # and one is outbound as shown in the example above.  A full list of possible predicates are defined by predicate_mappings
      #
      # For the oral_history relationship in the example above the following helper methods are created:
      #  oral_history: returns array of OralHistory objects that have this AudioRecord with predicate :has_part 
      #  oral_history_ids: Return array of pids for OralHistory objects that have this AudioRecord with predicate :has_part
      #  oral_history_query: Return solr query that can be used to retrieve related objects as solr documents
      # 
      # For the outbound relationship "similar_audio" there are two additional methods to append and remove objects from that relationship
      # since it is managed internally:
      #  similar_audio: Return array of AudioRecord objects that have been added to similar_audio relationship
      #  similar_audio_ids:  Return array of AudioRecord object pids that have been added to similar_audio relationship
      #  similar_audio_query: Return solr query that can be used to retrieve related objects as solr documents
      #  similar_audio_append: Add an AudioRecord object to the similar_audio relationship
      #  similar_audio_remove: Remove an AudioRecord from the similar_audio relationship

RubyFedora and ActiveFedora provide a set of Ruby gems for creating and managing objects in the Fedora Repository Architecture ("http://fedora-commons.org":http://fedora-commons.org).  ActiveFedora is loosely based on "ActiveRecord" in Rails.  The 3.x series of ActiveFedora depends on Rails 3, specifically activemodel and activesupport.

h2. Getting Help

* Community Discussions & Mailing List are located at "http://groups.google.com/group/active-fedora":http://groups.google.com/group/active-fedora
* Developers hang out on IRC in #projecthydra on freenet.

h2. Installation

The gem is hosted on gemcutter.

<pre>gem install active-fedora</pre>

h2. Getting Started

The "ActiveFedora Console Tour":https://github.com/projecthydra/active_fedora/wiki/Getting-Started:-Console-Tour  gives you a brief tour through ActiveFedora's features on the command line.

h2. Generators

You can generate a model inheriting from ActiveFedora::Base.

<pre>rails generate active_fedora:model Book</pre>

h2. Testing (this Gem)

In order to run the RSpec tests, you need to have a copy of the ActiveFedora source code, and then run bundle install in the source directory.  Testing requires hydra-jetty, which contains version for Fedora and Solr.  Setting up and maintaining hydra-jetty for the purposes of testing this gem is all accomplished via

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/projecthydra/active_fedora.git
cd /wherever/active_fedora/is
bundle install
</pre>

h3. Using the continuous integration server

You can test ActiveFedora using the same process as our continuous integration server.  To do that, unzip a copy
of hydra-jetty first.  This includes copies of Fedora and Solr which are used during the testing process.

<pre>
  rake jetty:unzip 
</pre>

Once hydra-jetty is unzipped, the ci rake task will spin up jetty, import the fixtures, and run the tests for you.

<pre>
  rake active_fedora:ci
</pre>

h3. Testing Manually

If you want to run the tests manually, follow these instructions.

You need to have a copy of hydra-jetty running.  To do this, download a working copy of "hydra-jetty":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty, cd into its root and run 

<pre>
java -jar start.jar
</pre>

Now you're ready to run the tests.  In the directory where active_fedora is installed, run

<pre>
  rake active_fedora:rspec environment=test
</pre>

h2. Predicate Mappings

ActiveFedora versions 2.2.1 and higher provides specialized control over the predicate mappings used by SemanticNode.  In order to provide your own mappings, 
you must supply a predicate_mappings.yml in the same format as the config/predicate_mappings.yml file shipped with the ActiveFedora gem.  Place the file in the same directory
as your fedora.yml file and use the current method of initializing ActiveFedora:

<pre>
ActiveFedora.init("/path/to/my/config/fedora.yml")
</pre>

If no predicate_mappings.yml file is found, ActiveFedora will use the default mappings.
